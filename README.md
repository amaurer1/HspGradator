# HspGradator
Image gradation allows the adaption and optimization of images using color models and mathematical curves, so-called gradation curves. HspGradator implements HSP, a new color model which incorporates the perceived brightness. The gradation curves are modelled with finite splines, also a new technique, which takes an intermediate position between line segments and cubic splines. Other color models like HSL or CIE-HCL and other types of gradation curves like cubic splines are also available.
