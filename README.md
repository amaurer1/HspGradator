# HspGradator
Image gradation allows the adaption and optimization of images using color models and mathematical curves, the so-called gradation curves. HspGradator implements HSP, a new color model which incorporates the perceived brightness. The gradation curves are modelled with finite splines, also a new technique, which takes an intermediate position between line segments and cubic splines. Other color models like HSL or CIE-HCL and other types of gradation curves like cubic splines are also available. The result can be analyzed by the comparison of the modified image with the original image as well as by interpretation of histograms.
